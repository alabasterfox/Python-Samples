# Python Challenge: Fizz Buzz
Write a function that counts numbers from 1 to n and prints the number. 
- If the number is divisible by 3 then print "fizz" 
- If the number is divisible by 5 print "buzz"
- If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 print "fizzbuzz"
<br/>

The function must be called <strong>fizz_buzz(...)</strong>. Your function should return the correct word ("fizz", "buzz", or "fizzbuzz"), or the number if it's not divisible by either 3 or 5. 


The function should always return a string (i.e. - numbers should be converted to strings).

Remember to annotate the fuction and include a Docstring

Include a loop, to test the function for values from 1 to 100, inclusive
