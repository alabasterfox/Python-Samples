# Write a small program that assigns the value 5 to one variable, called x and the value 7 to another variable called y.

# Your program should then use an if statement to compare the values and print out "x is greater than y" if x is greater or "x is smaller than y" if y is greater. If x equals y print out "x equals y"

x = 5
y = 7

if x > y:
    print("x is greater than y")
elif x < y:
    print("x is smaller than y")
else:
    print("x equals y")
