## Else Statement


<strong>Pythagoras theorem</strong> says: In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse side is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides.

Write a program that takes lengths of triangle sides as inputs, and output whether our triangle is right-angled or not. If the triangle is right-angled, the program should output "Right-angled", and "Not right-angled" if it's not.

<strong>Sample Input</strong>
<br/>
3 <br/>
4 <br/>
7 <br/>

<strong>Sample Output</strong>
<br/>
Not right-angled
